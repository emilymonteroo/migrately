Migrately is a web application that aims to simplify the U.S. visa and immigration journey by combining the power of community and technology. Migrately is an MVP, and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code. I was responsible for creating functionality in the back end as well as front end. Below is a list of actions I did to fulfill my responsibilities. 

- Engineered role-based components in React to achieve a secure experience for users and admin
while managing their data.
- Led the design and development of the UI for the attorney licenses component and used react
table to render attorney data.
- Enhanced application performance by implementing lazy loading.
- Designed and built RESTful API connections by constructing stored procedures, controllers and
services.
- Tested each HTTP method to ensure their correct endpoints in Postman.
- Created and maintained SQL stored procedures and tables with joins, Primary and Foreign Key
constraints using T-SQL to generate data reports with appropriate filters.
- Implemented client and server-side data validation using Formik, Yup, .NET and T-SQL.
- Utilized Git and GitHub for source control and repository management.
- Conducted code reviews, daily stand-ups, product demos and sprints using Agile methodology with
fellow engineers.
